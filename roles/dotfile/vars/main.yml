# This file defines how dotfiles are symlinked from the repository to your home directory.
# Three categories handle different symlinking strategies:

# DIRECTLY: Simple 1:1 mapping with dot prefix
# - Items are symlinked as: ~/dotfiles/data/{item} -> ~/.{item}
# - Use for: standard dotfiles that go directly in home with a dot prefix
# - Examples:
#   - "zshrc" becomes ~/.zshrc
#   - "tmux.conf" becomes ~/.tmux.conf
directly:
  - bin
  - lib
  - gtkrc-2.0
  - nano
  - nanorc
  - scalafmt.conf
  - themes
  - tmux.conf
  - wgetrc
  - xinitrc
  - Xresources
  - Xresources.d
  - zsh
  - zshrc
  - p10k.zsh
  - work
  - vpn

# PARTIALLY: Selective symlinking from directories
# - Only specific files/subdirs within these directories are symlinked
# - The directory itself is created, but only selected contents are linked
# - Use for: large directories where you only want to manage specific files
# - Example:
#   - "config" means only files in ~/dotfiles/data/config/* are individually
#     symlinked into ~/.config/*, not the entire directory
partially:
  - config

# CUSTOM: Full control over source and destination paths
# - Allows non-standard path mappings (no automatic dot prefix)
# - Use for: files that need to go somewhere other than ~/.{name}
# - Format:
#     src: path/in/repository (relative to ~/dotfiles/data/)
#     dest: path/in/home (relative to ~/, no automatic dot added)
custom:
  - src: Code/User/settings.json
    dest: .config/Code/User/settings.json
  - src: Code/User/keybindings.json
    dest: .config/Code/User/keybindings.json
